## Project Overview
Welcome to my project! This README will help you understand the purpose of the application and how it works in simple terms.

## What is This Project About?
This project is a software application designed to manage various aspects of a university or educational institution. It helps in managing:

**Users:** People who use the system, like administrators, students, and lecturers.
**Modules:** Courses or subjects offered by the institution.
**Assessments:** Tests or exams given to students.
Types of Modules and Assessments: Categories to organize modules and assessments.

## Key Features
### User Management
- **Add Users:** You can add new students or lecturers.
- **Update User Information:** Modify details like name, email, or role.
- **Delete Users:** Remove users who are no longer part of the institution.
- **Search Users:** Find users by their name.

### Module Management
- **Add Modules:** Add new courses or subjects.
- **Update Modules:** Change details about a course, like its name or description.
- **Delete Modules:** Remove courses that are no longer offered.
- **Search Modules:** Find courses by their name.

### Assessment Management
- **Add Assessments:** Create new tests or exams for students.
- **Update Assessments:** Modify the details of an existing assessment.
- **Delete Assessments:** Remove assessments that are no longer needed.
- **Search Assessments:** Find assessments by their description.

### Reporting
- **Generate Reports:** Create reports based on various criteria like assessment names and dates.

## How It Works
### Connecting to the Database
The application connects to a database where all the information is stored. SQL

### Performing Operations
You can perform various operations (like adding or updating data) through simple actions.

### Retrieving Data
The system can fetch data and display it as needed, such as listing all students in a module or all assessments for a course.

## Simple Workflow
1. **Login:** Start by logging into the system with your credentials.
2. **Navigate:** Use the menu to go to the section you want (Users, Modules, Assessments, etc.).
3. **Perform Actions:** Add, update, delete, or search for information as needed.
4. **Generate Reports:** Use the reporting feature to get insights and summaries of the data.

## Who Can Use This?
This application is designed for:

- **Administrators:** People who manage the system and data.
- **Lecturers:** Educators who need to manage their courses and assessments.
- **Students:** Individuals who want to view their modules and assessments.


## Conclusion
While the application effectively addresses various aspects of managing educational institutions, there might be occasional issues such as database connectivity problems. However, I am committed to providing support and resolving any issues promptly to ensure a smooth user experience.

I am experiencing a technical issue with the application. Specifically, it is not displaying the exact assessment for the student, which I am aware of how to resolve. However, I have encountered a complication. I previously had SQL Developer installed on my system, which I downloaded in February 2023, but I have since uninstalled it. Unfortunately, I am now unable to attach the database instance that I deleted to the new version of the application that I downloaded in 2024. Initially, the attachment was successful, but the application is now requiring the deleted database instance, which is no longer available. I kindly request assistance in resolving this issue
